/* 
    Create a function to determine the max amount of
    servings that can be made based on a recipe and
    available ingredients.
    Input:
        - recipe object where keys are ingredient names
        and values are unit required (int)
        - available ingredients object where keys are ingredient
        names and values are unit available (int)
    Output:
        int (max servings)
    Side note (not needed for solution): Realistically, the values
    would be an object as well with the keys: unit (unit of measure), and amount.
    If the available ingredient was stored in a different unit,
    a conversion table would be needed to convert units of measure.
